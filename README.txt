Owh Translate
version 6.x-0.0
---------------------
This module is still in Beta. 

Version 6.x-0.0 sets up a multilingual English/Spanish
Owh website, with English as the default language.

On installation, all existing content is set to English, 
except News Clips (which are left language neutral).


Installation
--------------------
1. Enable Owh Translate. 
   - All nodes (except news_clip nodes) are set to "English". 
   - Owh Translate tries to make existing Main Menu and Secondary Menu items English.
2. Enable the Spanish Menus module. (This creates Spanish named menu items.)
3. Manually set language for all menu items. (Automating this is still in
development.)
6. Confirm all English primary and secondary menus have Spanish counterparts.
7. Make a list of buttons that need Spanish counterparts and create them.
